# PersonSpawner

This script creates random pictures of persons that does not exist for further use.

## Installation

Just grab the `exe` file from this [release](https://github.com/Mux-Mastermann/PersonSpawner/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

## Usage

The program will ask you how many persons you want to create. After providing a positive integer (between `1` and `50`) it will scrape the desired amount of images from the web and saves them as a`.png` file to the folder where you exe is located. Be aware that other .png files in that folder with the name `person[i].png` will be overwritten.

## Credits

All images are created by the remarkable [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/). All honor is due to them!

## Disclaimer

Like mentioned before, all those created persons does not actually exist! Any similarity with real human beings are purely coincidental.
